          <p>
            12.1 These Terms of Use, and any rights and licences granted to you
            under these Terms of Use, cannot be transferred or assigned by you
            to a third party. However, these Terms of Use may be assigned by us,
            at any time, without notice to you.
          </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h3>13. Waiver</h3>
          <p>
            13.1 If we fail to exercise or delay in exercising the right, power
            or remedy, we do not waive the right, power or remedy.
          </p>
          <p>
            13.2 If we do not act in relation to a breach by you of these Terms
            of Use, this does not waive our right to act with respect to that
            breach or subsequent or similar breaches.
          </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h3>14. Enforceability</h3>
          <p>
            14.1 If any provision of these Terms of Use is found to be illegal,
            invalid or unenforceable by a court of law in respect of a
            jurisdiction, then that provision will not apply in that
            jurisdiction and is deemed not to have been included in the Terms of
            Use in that jurisdiction. This will not affect the remainder of the
            remaining provisions.
          </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h3>15. Governing law</h3>
